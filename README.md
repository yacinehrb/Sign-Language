# Sign Language Translator

A deep learning-based application that translates sign language gestures into text or speech using Python, TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project aims to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-sign language users.

## Overview

Sign languages are visual languages using hand gestures, facial expressions, and body postures. This project utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize these gestures and translate them into human-readable text.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Detects and classifies static and dynamic sign language gestures.  
- **Translation:** Converts recognized gestures into text or speech.  
- **Real-Time Processing:** Utilizes a webcam or video feed for live gesture recognition.  

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Machine Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-translator.git
   cd sign-language-translator
